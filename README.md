## Description
Sitting for too long at the computer can lead to stress and physical strain, so we should go to exercise.
But before going out to exercise, there are many factors that affect the decision to exercise, such as the 
AQI (Air Quality Index) in your area and the temperature to beware Heat Stroke and danger from dust.
Our project will help you decide whether to exercise inside or outside based on the AQI and temperature in your area.
